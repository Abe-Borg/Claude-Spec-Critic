Overlap adjoining pipe insulation by not less than two times the thickness of pipe insulation, or one pipe diameter, whichever is thicker.  For valves, insulate up to and including the bonnets, valve stuffing-box studs, bolts, and nuts.  Fill joints, seams, and irregular surfaces with insulating cement.

Insulate strainers using preformed fitting insulation or sectional pipe insulation of same material, density, and thickness as used for adjacent pipe.  Overlap adjoining pipe insulation by not less than two times the thickness of pipe insulation, or one pipe diameter, whichever is thicker.  Fill joints, seams, and irregular surfaces with insulating cement.  Insulate strainers so strainer basket flange or plug can be easily removed and replaced without damaging the insulation and jacket.  Provide a removable reusable insulation cover.  For below-ambient services, provide a design that maintains vapor barrier.

Insulate flanges and unions using a section of oversized preformed pipe insulation.  Overlap adjoining pipe insulation by not less than two times the thickness of pipe insulation, or one pipe diameter, whichever is thicker.

Cover segmented insulated surfaces with a layer of finishing cement and coat with a mastic.  Install vapor-barrier mastic for below-ambient services and a breather mastic for above-ambient services.  Reinforce the mastic with fabric-reinforcing mesh.  Trowel the mastic to a smooth and well-shaped contour.

For services not specified to receive a field-applied jacket except for flexible elastomeric and polyolefin, install fitted PVC cover over elbows, tees, strainers, valves, flanges, and unions.  Terminate ends with PVC end caps.  Tape PVC covers to adjoining insulation facing using PVC tape.

Stencil or label the outside insulation jacket of each union with the word "union."  Match size and color of pipe labels.

Insulate instrument connections for thermometers, pressure gages, pressure temperature taps, test connections, flow meters, sensors, switches, and transmitters on insulated pipes.  Shape insulation at these connections by tapering it to and around the connection with insulating cement and finish with finishing cement, mastic, and flashing sealant.

Install removable insulation covers at locations indicated.  Installation shall conform to the following:

Make removable flange and union insulation from sectional pipe insulation of same thickness as that on adjoining pipe.  Install same insulation jacket as adjoining pipe insulation.

When flange and union covers are made from sectional pipe insulation, extend insulation from flanges or union long at least two times the insulation thickness over adjacent pipe insulation on each side of flange or union.  Secure flange cover in place with stainless-steel or aluminum bands.  Select band material compatible with insulation and jacket.

Construct removable valve insulation covers in same manner as for flanges, except divide the two-part section on the vertical center line of valve body.

When covers are made from block insulation, make two halves, each consisting of mitered blocks wired to stainless-steel fabric.  Secure this wire frame, with its attached insulation, to flanges with tie wire.  Extend insulation at least 2 inches over adjacent pipe insulation on each side of valve.  Fill space between flange or union cover and pipe insulation with insulating cement.  Finish cover assembly with insulating cement applied in two coats.  After first coat is dry, apply and trowel second coat to a smooth finish.

Unless a PVC jacket is indicated in field-applied jacket schedules, finish exposed surfaces with a metal jacket.

Testing Agency:  Engage a qualified testing agency to perform tests and inspections.

Perform tests and inspections.

Tests and Inspections:

Inspect pipe, fittings, strainers, and valves, randomly selected by Architect, by removing field-applied jacket and insulation in layers in reverse order of their installation.  Extent of inspection shall be limited to three locations of straight pipe, three locations of threaded fittings, three locations of welded fittings, two locations of threaded strainers, two locations of welded strainers, three locations of threaded valves, and three locations of flanged valves for each pipe service defined in the "Piping Insulation Schedule, General" Article.

See Section 014000 "Quality Requirements" for retesting and reinspecting requirements and Section 017300 "Execution" for requirements for correcting the Work.

All insulation applications will be considered defective Work if sample inspection reveals noncompliance with requirements.

PIPING INSULATION SCHEDULE, GENERAL

Acceptable preformed pipe and tubular insulation materials and thicknesses are identified for each piping system and pipe size range.  If more than one material is listed for a piping system, selection from materials listed is Contractor's option.

Items Not Insulated:  Unless otherwise indicated, do not install insulation on the following:

Drainage piping located in crawl spaces.

Underground piping.

Chrome-plated pipes and fittings unless there is a potential for personnel injury.

Piping insulation schedules in first three articles below specify commonly used insulation materials and thicknesses by pipe size range for each service.  LEED Prerequisite EA 2 requires that pipe insulation thickness comply with ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1 table titled "Minimum Pipe Insulation Thickness."  Not all materials and thicknesses may be suitable for a specific project.  Revise to suit Project after considering all parameters that impact selection.  Do not duplicate requirements inserted in "Insulation Materials" Article.  See Evaluations for more information and guidance.

Because cellular glass is brittle, the minimum thickness recommended is 1-1/2 inches (38 mm).  Potential for breakage increases if thinner insulation is used.

Polyisocyanurate thickness is limited to 1 inch (25 mm) to meet a flame-spread index of 25 and a smoke-developed index of 50.  Condensation control and energy efficiency are limited by thickness.

Tubular flexible elastomeric is not available in sizes larger than NPS 6 (DN 150).  Larger pipe sizes require sheets to be cut to size.  Thickness is limited to 1 inch (25 mm) to meet a flame-spread index of 25 and a smoke-developed index of 50.  Condensation control and energy efficiency are limited by thickness.

Tubular polyolefin is not available in sizes larger than NPS 4 (DN 100).  Larger pipe sizes require sheets to be cut to size.  Thickness is limited to 1 inch (25 mm) to meet a flame-spread index of 25 and a smoke-developed index of 50.  Condensation control and energy efficiency are limited by thickness.

OUTDOOR, UNDERGROUND PIPING INSULATION SCHEDULE

Insulation specified in this article is limited to those insulation types that have high compressive strength.  Other insulation types may be considered acceptable and should be evaluated on a project basis.  Cellular glass is best suited for applications below 250 deg F (121 deg C) because of its moisture-resistant properties.

Loose-fill insulation, for belowground piping, is specified in Section 232113.13 "Underground Hydronic Piping”.

INDOOR, FIELD-APPLIED JACKET SCHEDULE

Possible variations of jackets by location are endless.  This article specifies locations in two broad categories:  concealed and exposed.  Revise if additional delineation is necessary.

Install jacket over insulation material.  For insulation with factory-applied jacket, install the field-applied jacket over the factory-applied jacket.

If more than one material is listed, selection from materials listed is Contractor's option.

Piping, Concealed:

None.

Piping, Exposed:

None.

OUTDOOR, FIELD-APPLIED JACKET SCHEDULE

Possible variations of jackets by location are endless.  This article specifies locations in two broad categories:  concealed and exposed.  Revise if additional delineation is necessary.

30-mil (0.8-mm) or heavier PVC is recommended for outdoor applications.  40-mil (1.0-mm) PVC does not meet a flame-spread index of 25 and a smoke-developed index of 50; however, a flame-spread or smoke-developed index is not a requirement for outdoor applications.

0.024-inch (0.61-mm) or heavier aluminum is recommended for outdoor applications.

Painted aluminum increases surface emissivity and provides added chemical resistance.  See Evaluations for discussion of emissivity.

0.016-inch (0.41-mm) or heavier stainless steel is recommended for outdoor applications.

Z-shaped locking seam is recommended for metal jackets located in unprotected applications that are exposed to severe weather.

None.

Piping, Exposed:

Painted Aluminum, Corrugated: 0.024 inch thick.

UNDERGROUND, FIELD-INSTALLED INSULATION JACKET

For underground direct-buried piping applications, install underground direct-buried jacket over insulation material.
