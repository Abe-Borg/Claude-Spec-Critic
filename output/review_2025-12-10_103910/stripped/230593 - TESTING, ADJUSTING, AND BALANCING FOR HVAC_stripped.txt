GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR TESTING AND BALANCING

Perform testing and balancing procedures on each system according to the procedures contained in AABC's "National Standards for Total System Balance", ASHRAE 111, and SMACNA's "HVAC Systems - Testing, Adjusting, and Balancing" and in this Section.

LEED Prerequisite IEQ 1 requires compliance with requirements in ASHRAE 62.1, Section 7.2.2 - "Air Balancing."  ASHRAE 62.1 requires that ventilation systems be balanced according to ASHRAE 111 or SMACNA's "HVAC Systems - Testing, Adjusting, and Balancing," or be equivalent at least to extent necessary to verify compliance with the standard.

Comply with requirements in ASHRAE 62.1, Section 7.2.2 - "Air Balancing."

Cut insulation, ducts, pipes, and equipment cabinets for installation of test probes to the minimum extent necessary for TAB procedures.

After testing and balancing, patch probe holes in ducts with same material and thickness as used to construct ducts.

After testing and balancing, install test ports and duct access doors that comply with requirements in Section 233300 "Air Duct Accessories."

Install and join new insulation that matches removed materials.  Restore insulation, coverings, vapor barrier, and finish according to Section 230713 "Duct Insulation," Section 230716 "HVAC Equipment Insulation," and Section 230719 "HVAC Piping Insulation."

Mark equipment and balancing devices, including damper-control positions, valve position indicators, fan-speed-control levers, and similar controls and devices, with paint or other suitable, permanent identification material to show final settings.

Verify that motor starters are equipped with properly sized thermal protection.

Check dampers for proper position to achieve desired airflow path.

Check for airflow blockages.

Check condensate drains for proper connections and functioning.

Check for proper sealing of air-handling-unit components.

Verify that air duct system is sealed as specified in Section 233113 "Metal Ducts."

PROCEDURES FOR CONSTANT-VOLUME AIR SYSTEMS

Adjust fans to deliver total indicated airflows within the maximum allowable fan speed listed by fan manufacturer.

Measure total airflow.

Where sufficient space in ducts is unavailable for Pitot-tube traverse measurements, measure airflow at terminal outlets and inlets and calculate the total airflow.

Measure fan static pressures as follows to determine actual static pressure:

Measure outlet static pressure as far downstream from the fan as practical and upstream from restrictions in ducts such as elbows and transitions.

Measure static pressure directly at the fan outlet or through the flexible connection.

Measure inlet static pressure of single-inlet fans in the inlet duct as near the fan as possible, upstream from the flexible connection, and downstream from duct restrictions.

Select the terminal unit that is most critical to the supply-fan airflow and static pressure.  Measure static pressure.  Adjust system static pressure so the entering static pressure for the critical terminal unit is not less than the sum of the terminal-unit manufacturer's recommended minimum inlet static pressure plus the static pressure needed to overcome terminal-unit discharge system losses.

Measure total system airflow.  Adjust to within indicated airflow.

Set terminal units at maximum airflow and adjust controller or regulator to deliver the designed maximum airflow.  Use terminal-unit manufacturer's written instructions to make this adjustment.

Measure operating static pressure at the sensor that controls the supply fan if one is installed, and verify operation of the static-pressure controller.

Set supply fan at minimum airflow if minimum airflow is indicated.  Measure static pressure to verify that it is being maintained by the controller.

Set terminal units at minimum airflow and adjust controller or regulator to deliver the designed minimum airflow.  Check air outlets for a proportional reduction in airflow the same as described for constant-volume air systems.

If air outlets are out of balance at minimum airflow, report the condition but leave the outlets balanced for maximum airflow.

Measure the return airflow to the fan while operating at maximum return airflow and minimum outdoor airflow.

Adjust the fan and balance the return-air ducts and inlets the same as described for constant-volume air systems.

Pressure-Dependent, Variable-Air-Volume Systems with Diversity:  After the fan systems have been adjusted, adjust the variable-air-volume systems as follows:

INSPECTIONS

Initial Inspection:

After testing and balancing are complete, operate each system and randomly check measurements to verify that the system is operating according to the final test and balance readings documented in the final report.

Check the following for each system:

Measure airflow of at least 10 percent of air outlets.

Measure water flow of at least 5 percent of terminals.

Measure room temperature at each thermostat/temperature sensor.  Compare the reading to the set point.

Verify that balancing devices are marked with final balance position.

Note deviations from the Contract Documents in the final report.

Final Inspection:

After initial inspection is complete and documentation by random checks verifies that testing and balancing are complete and accurately documented in the final report, request that a final inspection be made by [Architect] [Owner] [Construction Manager] [Commissioning Authority].

The TAB contractor's test and balance engineer shall conduct the inspection in the presence of [Architect] [Owner] [Construction Manager] [Commissioning Authority].

[Architect] [Owner] [Construction Manager] [Commissioning Authority] shall randomly select measurements, documented in the final report, to be rechecked.  Rechecking shall be limited to either 10 percent of the total measurements recorded or the extent of measurements that can be accomplished in a normal 8-hour business day.

If rechecks yield measurements that differ from the measurements documented in the final report by more than the tolerances allowed, the measurements shall be noted as "FAILED."

If the number of "FAILED" measurements is greater than 10 percent of the total measurements checked during the final inspection, the testing and balancing shall be considered incomplete and shall be rejected.

See Section 014000 "Quality Requirements" for retesting and reinspecting requirements and Section 017300 "Execution" for requirements for correcting the Work.

TAB Work will be considered defective if it does not pass final inspections.  If TAB Work fails, proceed as follows:

Recheck all measurements and make adjustments.  Revise the final report and balancing device settings to include all changes; resubmit the final report and request a second final inspection.

If the second final inspection also fails, Owner may contract the services of another TAB contractor to complete TAB Work according to the Contract Documents and deduct the cost of the services from the original TAB contractor's final payment.

Prepare test and inspection reports.

ADDITIONAL TESTS

Within 90 days of completing TAB, perform additional TAB to verify that balanced conditions are being maintained throughout and to correct unusual conditions.

Seasonal Periods:  If initial TAB procedures were not performed during near-peak summer and winter conditions, perform additional TAB during near-peak summer and winter conditions.
