EXECUTION

PREPARATION

Clean piping and equipment surfaces of substances that could impair bond of identification devices, including dirt, oil, grease, release agents, and incompatible primers, paints, and encapsulants.

EQUIPMENT LABEL INSTALLATION

Install or permanently fasten labels on each major item of mechanical equipment.

Locate equipment labels where accessible and visible.

PIPE LABEL INSTALLATION

Piping Color-Coding:  Painting of piping is specified in other sections.

Locate pipe labels where piping is exposed or above accessible ceilings in finished spaces; machine rooms; accessible maintenance spaces such as shafts, tunnels, and plenums; and exterior exposed locations as follows:

Near each valve and control device.

Near each branch connection, excluding short takeoffs for fixtures and terminal units.  Where flow pattern is not obvious, mark each pipe at branch.

Near penetrations through walls, floors, ceilings, and inaccessible enclosures.

At access doors, manholes, and similar access points that permit view of concealed piping.

Near major equipment items and other points of origination and termination.

Spaced at maximum intervals of 50 feet along each run.  Reduce intervals to 25 feet in areas of congested piping and equipment.

On piping above removable acoustical ceilings.  Omit intermediately spaced labels.

Pipe Label Color Schedule:

Chilled-Water Piping:

Background Color:  Blue.

Letter Color:  White.

ASME A13.1 Colors and Designs:  For hazardous material exhaust.

Locate labels near points where ducts enter into concealed spaces and at maximum intervals of 50 feet in each space where ducts are exposed or concealed by removable ceiling system.

VALVE-TAG INSTALLATION

Revise this article as required to delete an entire piping system from tagging or other changes.  A schedule is helpful for complex projects.  Retain and revise first paragraph below if a schedule is prepared.

Install tags on valves and control devices in piping systems, except check valves; valves within factory-fabricated equipment units; shutoff valves; faucets; convenience and lawn-watering hose connections; and HVAC terminal devices and similar roughing-in connections of end-use fixtures and units.  List tagged valves in a valve schedule.

Valve-Tag Application Schedule:  Tag valves according to size, shape, and color scheme and with captions similar to those indicated in the following subparagraphs:

Other valve-tag sizes, shapes, colors, and letter colors may be available if required.

Valve-Tag Size and Shape:

All Valve-Tags:  1-1/2 inches minimum, round.

Select contrasting valve-tag color and letter color in two subparagraphs below for each service.  Retain "Natural" option for brass or stainless-steel valve tags.
