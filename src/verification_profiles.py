"""Verification profiles by issue type.

The classifier groups findings by *kind* (California / code-standard /
manufacturer / constructability / internal-coordination) so the verifier
can attach profile-specific authoritative-source guidance to its system
prompt. Web-search budget is severity-based and identical across
profiles — see :func:`profile_max_uses`.

The classifier is keyword-based rather than LLM-driven:

- It runs on every finding before verification, so it has to be cheap.
- The signal in the finding text (``codeReference``, ``issue``,
  ``existingText``, ``replacementText``) is usually unambiguous.
- A wrong classification at worst picks the wrong priority-source
  paragraph; the grounding invariant in
  :func:`src.source_grounding.validate_cited_sources` is the real
  safety net.

Public surface:

- :class:`VerificationProfile` — the small closed enum.
- :func:`classify_finding_profile` — pure function over a ``Finding``.
- :func:`profile_max_uses` — severity-based search budget (profile arg
  is accepted for call-site compatibility but ignored).
