Alright, let's dig into this collection of specs. What we've got here is a mixed bag — some architectural, some plumbing, and one fire suppression spec that looks like it time-traveled from the early 2000s.

First, the good news: The plumbing specs (22 05 18, 22 05 23, 22 05 29) are using the correct 2022 CPC references, which tells me someone was at least paying attention to the code cycle. The acoustic ceiling spec (09 51 00) is reasonably clean and properly formatted.

Now for the fun part. Section 15071? That's Division 15 MasterFormat numbering, which was deprecated back in 2004. We're on the 2020 MasterFormat now, folks. This spec should be renumbered to 21 05 48 or similar. Even better, the spec header literally says "Use this Section if Project is not in a seismic area" — but this is a California K-12 project under DSA jurisdiction. California. Seismic. You seeing the problem here? This entire specification is fundamentally wrong for the project. We should be using seismic-rated vibration controls, period.

The plumbing specs have some cross-referencing issues too. Section 22 05 23 references "Division 2" and "Division 15" — both outdated MasterFormat divisions. Division 2 became Division 31-33 (Sitework), and Division 15 split into Divisions 21-23. These references need updating.

I also noticed some coordination issues between specs. The hangers spec (22 05 29) references SMACNA Seismic Restraint Manual, which is good, but doesn't specify which edition. Meanwhile, the valve spec is missing any reference to seismic requirements for valve supports entirely.

The escutcheons spec (22 05 18) has a lot of editing artifacts and duplicative language that could confuse contractors. And while we're at it, multiple specs still contain AIA/ARCOM boilerplate editing instructions that should have been deleted before issue.

Found 18 issues total — 2 critical, 5 high, 6 medium, and 5 gripes. The fire suppression vibration control spec needs the most attention by far.
